        "#### **Symmetric Encryption**\n",
        "1. In symmetric encryption, the same private key is used for both the sender and receiver to decrypt the data. \n",
        "2. Hence, any hacker sniffing the communication channel can have access to both the private key and data to decrypt. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Asymmetric Encryption**\n",
        "1. In asymmetric encryption, a pair of keys are used instead; private and public keys. \n",
        "2. Public keys are sent and used by both the sender and receiver but they can only be used for encrypting data. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **SSH Example**\n",
        "1. SSH connection is an example of an asymmetric encryption. \n",
        "2. To access a remote server securely, the user runs ssh-keygen to generate a key pair (`id_rsa` - private key and `id_rsa.pub` - public key). \n",
        "3. In the remote server, add the public key entry into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` directory. \n",
        "4. The user runs `ssh -i id_rsa user1@server1` to securely access the remote server using their private key. \n",
        "5. Multiple users can generate their own key pairs and add their public keys into the remote servers .ssh directory too for access. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Web Server Example**\n",
        "The idea is to transfer the user's private symmetric keys to the web server securely using the web server's public key via asymmetric encryption. This will ensure only the user and web server have access to the user's private symmetric keys for HTTPs communication.\n",
        "1. The web server generates a key pair using:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "> openssl genrsa -out my-webserver.key 1024\n",
        "my-webserver.key # public key generated\n",

        "```\n",
        "The web server keeps the private key and sends out the public key.\n",
        "1. The user's browser receives the public key and uses it to encrypt their private key. \n",
        "1. The user's browser sends the encrypted user private key to the web server.\n",
        "1. Since the encrypted user private key is encrypted using the web server's public key, the web server can decrypt it using the web server's private key.\n",
        "1. Both parties have the same symmetric private keys that they can use to encrypt and decrypt data securely. \n",
        "1. Hackers that intercept the communication channel only has access to the web server's public key which can only encypt but not decrypt data. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Hacker's Spoof Web Server**\n",
        "1. The same asymmetric cryptography can be used to create an encrypted symmetric communication channel between the user and the hacker's spoof web server. \n",
        "1. The hacker can reroute your traffic to the hacker's web server and send you their public key. \n",
        "1. We need to find a way to verify the public keys we receive from any web server.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Web Server with Certificates Example**\n",
        "The web server will send you a certificate with the public key instead. The certificate will contain:\n",
        "    - Issuer Name (the name of the certificate authority)\n",
        "    - Serial Number of the Data\n",
        "    - Signature Algorithm (e.g.: SHA-256)\n",
        "    - Validatity Period/Date\n",
        "    - Subject Name (the main subject name of the web server)\n",
        "    - Subject Alternative Name (the alternative/aliases of the web server)\n",
        "    - Subject Public Key Info (the value of the public key)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Hacker's Spoof Web Server with Certificates**\n",
        "1. The hacker could do the same and send you a certificate with the public key too containing spoof certificate information. \n",
        "1. Hence, the most important factor to determine if the certificate is legitimate is which certificate authority signed the certificate?\n",
        "1. An unsafe certificate will most likely be a self-signed certificate.  \n",
        "1. The web browser checks the certificate authority (CA) who signed the public certificate received by the web server and may warn you if the CA is not trusted.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Certificate Authorities**\n",
        "1. CAs are well-known, trusted organizations (e.g.: Symantec, digitcert, GlobalSign) that can sign and validate your web server's certificates.\n",
        "1. When the web server generates a key pair using:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "> openssl genrsa -out my-webserver.key 1024\n",
        "my-webserver.key # public key generated\n",
        "> openssl rsa -in my-webserver.key -pubout > my-webserver.pem \n",
        "my-webserver.key my-webserver.pem # key pairs generated \n",
        "```\n",
        "The web server can then also perform a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using: \n",
        "```python \n",
        "> openssl req -new -key my-webserver.key -out my-webserver.csr -subj \"/C=US/ST=CA/O=MyOrg, Inc./CN=my-myserver.com\"\n",
        "my-webserver.key my-webserver.csr\n",
        "```\n",
        "1. The CA receives your CSR and validate your information. If verification is successful, they will sign and send back your certificate. \n",
        "1. The web server will now be able to use and send out public certificates that are signed by a Trusted CA that are trusted by the web browser.\n",
        "1. If a hacker were to make a CSR to the CA, the CA will reject the hacker's CSR if the hacker's verification fails. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How can we trust Public Certificate Authorities?**\n",
        "1. The CA generates their own private and public keys.\n",
        "1. The private keys are used to sign certificates by the CAs for every CSR.\n",
        "1. The public keys of all CAs are built in to every web browser's local database (this can viewed in the `Trusted Root Certificate Authorities` tab in the browser's certificate setting).\n",
        "1. The browser uses the CA's public key to validate any incoming public certificates that was signed by the CA.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How can we trust Private Certificate Authorities?**\n",
        "1. Internal websites such as your company's payroll or intranet domains cannot use the public CAs to validate their private certificates.\n",
        "1. Hence, companies host their own private CAs. \n",
        "1. Private CA servers are deployed internally to sign public certificates using their private key and distribute signed, trusted public certificates within the internal network. \n",
        "1. The public keys of your internal private CA servers can then be installed in all of your employee's web browser.\n",
        "1. This will help establish secure connectivity within your organization. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Summary**\n",
        "1. Data is encrypted using asymmetric encyption using a pair of private and public keys. \n",
        "1. A system administrator uses asymmetric encryption using key pairs to secure connectivity to the web servers. \n",
        "1. The web servers uses a pair of private and public keys to establish secure HTTPs traffic. \n",
        "1. The web server first sends a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)  to get their public key (in a form of a public certificate) signed by a Trusted Certificate Authority (CA). \n",
        "1. The CA uses its private key to sign the public certificate in the CSR if validation is successful.\n",
        "1. All user's web browsers would already have a copy of the CA's public key in the local database.\n",
        "1. The signed public certificate is sent back to the web server (who performed the CSR) and is configured with that certificate. \n",
        "1. Whenever a user accesses the web server, the signed public certificate is sent to the user's web browser.\n",
        "1. The user's web browser uses the CA's public key to validate the incoming signed public certificate from the web server. \n",
        "1. The web browser then generates its own symmetric private key to establish a secure HTTPs channel with the web server.\n",
        "1. The web browser uses the verified and signed public certificate from the web server to encrypt its symmetric private key. \n",
        "1. The encrypted symmetric private key is sent to the web server.\n",
        "1. Since the encypted user private key was encrypted with the server's public key, it can use its private key to decrypt the data and retrieve the user's symmetric private key. \n",
        "1. Both the user and server now have copies of the user's private key that have been sent over securely and will be used for secure HTTPs communications between both parties moving forward. \n",
        "1. Once the user establishes trust with the website, the user can use their username and password to authenticate to the web server. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How can web servers trust incoming clients?**\n",
        "1. Web servers can in turn request a certificate from the client. \n",
        "1. The client generates a pair of keys and have their public certificate (with the public key within) signed by a trusted CA via a CSR. \n",
        "1. The CA verifies the identity of the client and if the validation phase passes, the CA signs the certificate. \n",
        "1. The client then sends the signed public certificate to the web server \n",
