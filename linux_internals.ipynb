        "1. When it finds it, the shell will forks off a copy of itself using the `fork()` system call. \n",
        "1. If the fork succeeds, then in the child process the shell will run ‚Äòexec /bin/ls‚Äô which will replace the copy of the child shell with itself. \n",

        "**Detailed Explanation**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Step 1: `Find executable binary`*\n",
        "1. The shell reads what you have typed using the `getline()` function and tokenizes the line using the  `strtok()` function.\n",
        "1. It also checks if the first token of `ls` is a Shell `alias` or not. \n",
        "1. If the command is not a built-in (internal) function, the shell will find the `PATH` variable in the directory where it holds the absolute paths for all the executable binary files.\n",
        "*Step 2: `fork()`*\n",
        "1. Once it finds the binary for `ls` located at `/bin/ls`, the program is loaded in memory and a system call `fork()` is made. \n",
        "1. This creates the child process `ls` and the shell will be the parent process. \n",
        "1. `fork()` returns `0` to the child process so it knows it has to act as a child and returns the PID of the child to the parent process (e.g. the shell).\n",
        "\n",
        "*Step 3: `execve()`*\n",
        "1. Next, the `ls` process executes the system call `execve()` that provides a new address space with the program to run.\n",
        "1. Now, `ls` can start running its program. The `ls` utility uses a function to read the directories and files from the disk by consulting the underlying filesystem‚Äôs inode entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Step 4: `exit()`*\n",
        "1. Once the `ls` process has finished executing, it will perform the `exit()` system call with an integer `0` that denotes a normal execution and the kernel will free up its resources.\n",
