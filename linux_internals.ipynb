        "1. **Operating system:** This refers to the software and files that are installed on a system so\n",
        "that it can boot and execute programs. It includes the kernel, administration tools, and\n",
        "system libraries.\n",
        "1. **Kernel:** The kernel is the program that manages the system, including (depending on the\n",
        "kernel model) hardware devices, memory, and CPU scheduling. It runs in a privileged\n",
        "CPU mode that allows direct access to hardware, called kernel mode.\n",
        "1. **Process:** An OS abstraction and environment for executing a program. The program runs\n",
        "in user mode, with access to kernel mode (e.g., for performing device I/O) via system calls\n",
        "or traps into the kernel.\n",
        "1. **Thread:** An executable context that can be scheduled to run on a CPU. The kernel has\n",
        "multiple threads, and a process contains one or more.\n",
        "1. **Task:** A Linux runnable entity, which can refer to a process (with a single thread), a thread\n",
        "from a multithreaded process, or kernel threads.\n",
        "1. **BPF program:** A kernel-mode program running in the BPF1 execution environment.\n",
        "1. **Main memory:** The physical memory of the system (e.g., RAM).\n",
        "1. **Virtual memory:** An abstraction of main memory that supports multitasking and oversubscription.\n",
        "It is, practically, an infinite resource.\n",
        "1. **Kernel space:** The virtual memory address space for the kernel.\n",
        "1. **User space:** The virtual memory address space for processes.\n",
        "1. **User land:** User-level programs and libraries (e.g.: /usr/bin, /usr/lib).\n",
        "1. **Context switch:** A switch from running one thread or process to another. This is a normal\n",
        "function of the kernel CPU scheduler, and involves switching the set of running CPU\n",
        "registers (the thread context) to a new set.\n",
        "1. **Mode switch:** A switch between kernel and user modes.\n",
        "1. **System call (syscall):** A well-defined protocol for user programs to request the kernel to\n",
        "perform privileged operations, including device I/O.\n",
        "1. **Processor:** Not to be confused with process, a processor is a physical chip containing one\n",
        "or more CPUs.\n",
        "1. **Trap:** A signal sent to the kernel to request a system routine (privileged action). Trap types\n",
        "include system calls, processor exceptions, and interrupts.\n",
        "1. **Hardware interrupt:** A signal sent by physical devices to the kernel, usually to request\n",
        "servicing of I/O. An interrupt is a type of trap."

        "\n",
        "*Step 1: `Find executable binary`*\n",
        "1. The shell reads what you have typed using the `getline()` function and tokenizes the line using the  `strtok()` function.\n",
        "1. It also checks if the first token of `ls` is a Shell `alias` or not. \n",
        "1. If the command is not a built-in (internal) function, the shell will find the `PATH` variable in the directory where it holds the absolute paths for all the executable binary files.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Step 2: `fork()`*\n",
        "1. Once it finds the binary for `ls` located at `/bin/ls`, the program is loaded in memory and a system call `fork()` is made. \n",
        "1. This creates the child process `ls` and the shell will be the parent process. \n",
        "1. `fork()` returns `0` to the child process so it knows it has to act as a child and returns the PID of the child to the parent process (e.g. the shell).\n",

        "1. Next, the `ls` process executes the system call `execve()` that provides a new address space with the program to run.\n",

        "*Step 4: `exit()`*\n",
        "1. Once the `ls` process has finished executing, it will perform the `exit()` system call with an integer `0` that denotes a normal execution and the kernel will free up its resources.\n",
        "1. The child process also sends a `SIGCHLD` signal to the parent process to indicate that the child process has ended.\n",

        "1. When a process is active, it can either be running in \"user mode\" or \"kernel mode\".\n",

        "1. A process running in the user mode has limited capability and is controlled by a flag in the CPU.\n",
        "1. Eventhough the kernel memory is present in the process's memory map, the user space code is not allowed to access the kernel space code.\n",
        "1. When a process wants to do something other than move data around in its own (user space) virtual memory (e.g.: opening a file), it must make a system call to communicate with the kernel space.\n",
        "1. Each CPU architecture has it's unique way of making a system call but the basic remains the same (e.g.:\n",
        "A magic instruction is executed, the CPU turns on the \"privileged mode\" flag, and jumps to a special address in kernel space, the \"system call entry point\".)\n",
        "1. Now when the system call has reached the kernel space, the process is running in kernel mode and executes instructions from the kernel space memory.\n",
        "1. Taking the same example of open system call, to find the requested file, the kernel may consult with filesystem drivers (to figure out where the file is) and block device drivers (to load the necessary blocks from disk) or network device drivers and protocols (to load the file from a remote source).\n",
        "1. These drivers can be either built in or can be loaded as module but the key point that remains that they are the part of kernel space.\n",
        "1. Loading a module is done with a system call that asks the kernel to copy the module's code and data into kernel space and run its initialization code in kernel mode.\n",
        "1. If the kernel can't process the request then the process is made to sleep by the kernel and when the request is complete, the system call returns back to the user space.\n",
        "1. Returning back to user mode means restoring the CPU registers to what they were before coming to Kernel Mode and changing the CPU privilege level to non-privilege .\n",
        "1. Apart from system calls, there are other things that take CPU to kernel mode such as: \n",
        "    * **Page faults:** If the process tries to access a virtual memory address that doesn't have a physical address assigned to it then the CPU enters the Kernel mode  and jumps to page fault handler and the kernel sees whether the virtual addresss is valid or not and depending upon this it either tries to create a physical page for the given virtual address or if it can't then sends a segmentation fault signal (SIGSEGV).\n",
        "    * **Interrupts:** When the CPU receives some interrupt from the hardware then it jumps to the kernel mode and executes the interrupt handler and when the kernel is finished handing the interrupt the the code return to the user space where it was executing."
