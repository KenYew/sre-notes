        "1. Every process in linux utilizes its own separate virtual space.\n",
        "1. In a 32-bit architecture Linux system, user space address space corresponds to lower 3GB of virtual space and kernel space the upper 1GB.\n",
        "1. The kernel space virtual address space is shared between all the processes.\n",
        "1. When a process is active, it can either be running in \"user mode\" or \"kernel mode\".\n",
        "1. If a process is running in user mode, it means that the CPU is running the user space side of code.\n",
        "1. A process running in the user mode has limited capability and is controlled by a flag in the CPU.\n",
        "1. Eventhough the kernel memory is present in the process's memory map, the user space code is not allowed to access the kernel space code.\n",
        "1. When a process wants to do something other than move data around in its own (user space) virtual memory (e.g.: opening a file), it must make a system call to communicate with the kernel space.\n",
        "1. Each CPU architecture has it's unique way of making a system call but the basic remains the same (e.g.:\n",
        "A magic instruction is executed, the CPU turns on the \"privileged mode\" flag, and jumps to a special address in kernel space, the \"system call entry point\".)\n",
        "1. Now when the system call has reached the kernel space, the process is running in kernel mode and executes instructions from the kernel space memory.\n",
        "1. Taking the same example of open system call, to find the requested file, the kernel may consult with filesystem drivers (to figure out where the file is) and block device drivers (to load the necessary blocks from disk) or network device drivers and protocols (to load the file from a remote source).\n",
        "1. These drivers can be either built in or can be loaded as module but the key point that remains that they are the part of kernel space.\n",
        "1. Loading a module is done with a system call that asks the kernel to copy the module's code and data into kernel space and run its initialization code in kernel mode.\n",
        "1. If the kernel can't process the request then the process is made to sleep by the kernel and when the request is complete, the system call returns back to the user space.\n",
        "1. Returning back to user mode means restoring the CPU registers to what they were before coming to Kernel Mode and changing the CPU privilege level to non-privilege .\n",
        "1. Apart from system calls, there are other things that take CPU to kernel mode such as: \n",
        "    * **Page faults:** If the process tries to access a virtual memory address that doesn't have a physical address assigned to it then the CPU enters the Kernel mode  and jumps to page fault handler and the kernel sees whether the virtual addresss is valid or not and depending upon this it either tries to create a physical page for the given virtual address or if it can't then sends a segmentation fault signal (SIGSEGV).\n",
        "    * **Interrupts:** When the CPU receives some interrupt from the hardware then it jumps to the kernel mode and executes the interrupt handler and when the kernel is finished handing the interrupt the the code return to the user space where it was executing."

        "*Step 1: `Find executable binary`*\n",
        "1. The shell reads what you have typed using the `getline()` function and tokenizes the line using the  `strtok()` function.\n",
        "1. It also checks if the first token of `ls` is a Shell `alias` or not. \n",
        "1. If the command is not a built-in (internal) function, the shell will find the `PATH` variable in the directory where it holds the absolute paths for all the executable binary files.\n",
        "*Step 2: `fork()`*\n",
        "1. Once it finds the binary for `ls` located at `/bin/ls`, the program is loaded in memory and a system call `fork()` is made. \n",
        "1. This creates the child process `ls` and the shell will be the parent process. \n",
        "1. `fork()` returns `0` to the child process so it knows it has to act as a child and returns the PID of the child to the parent process (e.g. the shell).\n",
        "\n",
        "*Step 3: `execve()`*\n",
        "1. Next, the `ls` process executes the system call `execve()` that provides a new address space with the program to run.\n",

        "*Step 4: `exit()`*\n",
        "1. Once the `ls` process has finished executing, it will perform the `exit()` system call with an integer `0` that denotes a normal execution and the kernel will free up its resources.\n",
